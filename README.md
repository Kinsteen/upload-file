# Upload file

This is a helper script that helps uploading/downloading files to somewhere in the clouds, from a foreign location where you don't want to hassle to login on Google/NextCloud and stuff

## Deploy
You need to change the adresses in the upload.sh script, and create a `.env` with the `SECRET` variable, which is your secret for you TOTP.
